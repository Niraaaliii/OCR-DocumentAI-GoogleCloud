OCR with Document AI (Google Cloud) 📝🔍

📖 Overview

Google Cloud's Document AI is a powerful document understanding solution that extracts structured data from unstructured documents such as PDFs, invoices, and forms. It provides content classification, entity extraction, and advanced search capabilities to make document processing more efficient.

This project demonstrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Google Cloud Document AI and Python. It includes both Online (Synchronous) and Batch (Asynchronous) processing to extract text from scanned PDFs.

For this project, we use a scanned PDF of "Winnie the Pooh" by A.A. Milne, which has recently entered the public domain in the United States. This document was digitized by Google Books and serves as our sample input.

🎯 Objectives

By working on this project, you will learn how to:

✅ Enable the Document AI API in Google Cloud

✅ Authenticate API requests using a Google Cloud service account

✅ Install and use the Google Cloud Document AI Python Client

✅ Perform OCR on PDF files using both online and batch processing

✅ Extract and parse text from scanned documents
